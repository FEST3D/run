# How to run the code to solve a real problem
A few input files are needed by the [FEST-3D](https://fest3d.github.io/index.html) solver to perform any simulation. A Python script is provided here to facilitate the process of setting up all theses input files

## Caution
An edit-samplescript.py file is provided for the users. Edit the file to replace the sample values before attempting to run the file.

## Dependencies
 * **C++11 compiler**
 * **Python 3**
 * **bash**


## Inputs
First, we need to create a directory to perform simulation and save all the input/output data.<br>
```RunDir = 'Test'``` Give any name to the Run directory <br>
One of the important input is the grid/mesh files. FEST-3D code requires a separate file for each process.
If the domain is decomposed into 4 blocks, then 4 separate files are required. Although, you can give
any unique name to the grid files, for simplicity the python code expect grid file name in __grid_nn.txt__, where
the nn is the _block-number-1_. So, for 4 blocks, we will use the following: grid_00.txt, grid_01.txt, grid_02.txt, and
grid_03.txt. You should keep all the grid files in a separate folder and mention name of that folder 
at<br>
```GridDir='Mesh'```, here Mesh is the folder in which all the grid files are kept.<br>
```NumberOfBlocks = 1``` Total number of blocks<br>
Now, you are required to fix different parameters of the solver based on the problem you are simulating.
Meaning of the most input is self-explanatory from the name.
```Control['CFL'] = 1.0``` Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy number<br>
```Control['LoadLevel'] = 0``` Restart folder number <br>

```Control['InputFileFormat'] = 'vtk'``` Format of the solution file from which solution will be restarted <br>
```Control['InputDataFormat'] = 'ASCII'``` Type of the data in the restart file <br>. Similar to output data type, only ASCII is supported for now.<br>

## Steps to run Lid-Driven cavity tutorial
```bash 
$cd Tutorials/LidDrivenCavity
```
Change to the directory where test cases are stored.
```bash
$cd CreateBlocks/
$cd make
```
This will create a decomposed grid files for FEST-3D solver to run on.
```bash
$vi edit-automaton.py
```
```bash
$python edit-automaton.py
```
Execute the edit-automaton.py script

## Directory structure
Executing edit-automaton.py will create a directory with usual directory structure:

* __system__:all the input files including the mesh files and boundary condition file is located in this directory
* __time\_directory__: all the output files will be stored in this folder.
* __bin__: a softlink between original FEST-3D binary is stored here.
* __run.sh__: bash script to run the solver. This helps to remove log clutter on screen and save it in a log file named __out__ in the time\_directory/axu/ directory along with resnorm file which sotre the residual values. 


## Check Layout file
Although edit-automaton.py python script tries to handle the boundary condition on its own, it is still not full-proof. So, always check the layout.md file in the system/mesh/layout directory. Make sure all the boundary condition numbers are as you expect. In the case of pole boundary condition, some random number will be mentioned and required to change manually to -007. The layout file in explained in [documentation](https://fest3d.github.io/page/02_run/04_layout.html).

## Execute
```bash
$mpiexec.hydra -np 16 bin/FEST3D 
```
Instead of above command, on linux OS, you can use following command to run FEST-3D in the background:<br>
```nohup bash run.sh &```<br>
